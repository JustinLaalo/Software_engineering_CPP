List of files: 
	- Date.cc -> provide generic functions to handle date comparisons
	- Date.h -> initalizes all the classes and varibables in Date
	- Photo.cc -> enables basic photo comparion functions
	- Photo.h -> initalizes the Photo class and variables
	- PhotoArray.cc -> a colleciton of photo objects, this class allows us to handle photos on a wider scale
	- PhotoArray.h -> initalizes the photoArray class and variables
	- Album.cc -> wrapper class from PhotoArray, helps to have neater calls and code
	- Album.h -> initalizes the Album class and variables
	- AlbumArray.cc -> is a collection of Album objects, allows us to add or manipulate them
	- AlbumArray.h -> initalizes the AlbumArray class and variables
	- PhotoGram -> adds some new funcitonality to the AlbumArray class, helps us add photos and such to the Albums in the AlbumArray
	- PhotoGram.h -> initalizes the PhotoGram class and variables 
	- Client.cc -> uses PhotoGram and brings all of this together
	- Client.h -> initalizes the Client class and variables
Compilation Command: make all
Launching Command: ./a2
Instructions:
	- after running choose a number to test out that case
